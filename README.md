#Hour logging system

Second school project made using Spring MVC, Maven and JdbcTemplate for fetching/writing data from/to db.

CRUD, 2 user levels (Admin and user), password encoder, forgotten password reset feature with one-time url, mail sender,
Spring Authentication, bean validation(using annotations)

Much more shorter and better compared to our first project(Pizzeria)

Waiting for Your comments,
Thank You.
